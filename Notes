stuff to correct:

V stage 0- work with 0 threads
Vstage 1-  work with one thread
Vstage 2-  work with 2 threads
Vstage 3- work with 3 threads
Vstage 4- work with n threads


stuff to check:
V using pthreads
V mutexes and cv
V atomic variable (why can there be only one?) 
V barriers

- read docs and check all is working
V read ex3 description
V read forum questions.
X create my own client.
X ask tomer for tests

- check memory leaks with valgrind.

--------------------------
V waitForJob - implement
V closeJobHandle - implement
V make sure it fails if job is not finished. consider adding FINISHED bool, and decide what is released what the job is FINISHED but before closeJobHandle is called.

V jobHandle must wait until job is done.

-check for system call fails and other exceptions in the functions

V add semaphore for reduce phase

V make sure updating job state is protected

-create makefile and readme, with static library option

-test mapreducejob with multiple threads, multiple jobs

V currently the job doesnt close itself and does not know when considered done. should it be different?
